Company Profile
Hindu Endowments Board (HEB) is a statutory body set up under the Hindu Endowments Act in 1968. The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth appoints prominent figures from the public and private sectors of the Indian community as Board members. HEB’s primary function is to operate four Hindu endowments placed under its administration. These endowments include the Sri Mariamman Temple, Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, Sri Sivan Temple and Sri Vairavimada Kaliamman Temple. In addition to managing temples, HEB is involved in numerous initiatives that benefit the community. HEB’s broad based community service includes the administration of HEB-Ashram, a halfway house of IPC status to rehabilitate substance abusers. ‘Gift from the Heart’ a programme that provides disadvantaged families with free monthly food rations is offered through HEB-Ashram. In 2011, HEB started the HEB-Sivadas Education Fund – a financial assistance initiative that offers two different support schemes – one targeting pre-schoolers and the other meant for tertiary students (includes those attending polytechnics and ITEs). The scheme provides bursaries and grants to ensure that Hindu children are not deprived of a good education. Another education assistance scheme, the Rama Arunachalam and AR Mangayarkarasi Achi Fund, was set up to assist dyslexic children. Other major missions of HEB are the cultivation of values and morals in children through its Project Bhakti programme, and the promotion of health and wellness in the community. Such activities have elevated HEB to an active social organisation that cares for and caters to the secular as well as religious needs of Hindus. HEB actively supports interfaith activities and is a member of the Inter-Religious Organisation, Singapore. While HEB’s mission is to meet the spiritual and welfare needs of the Hindu community, its vision is to foster greater understanding and harmony amongst religions.

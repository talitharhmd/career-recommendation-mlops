about the team
at the heart of gojek’s businesses, we move things around. whether that’s people, food, packages, or fresh groceries moving things around boils down to understanding the best route, understanding traffic, and understanding locations. the cartography team is a platform team that surfaces mapping technologies needed by all internal product teams and business units within gojek. 
as chicken rice is to the people of singapore, the maps ops team is to cartography: providing the nourishment and power to sustain our business from the inside out. our main responsibility is to build data products for eta prediction, mapping errors detection, map-matching, locations search and ranking, and reverse geocoding. one of our most successful implementations is the generation of new pickup points via unsupervised learning and nlp.  we have deployed the pickup points generation and eta prediction models in our main markets and are aiming at scaling it to the wider region.
while our team is based all over the region, we are a tight-knit group who are bonded by two things: how to grow our maps using strong machine learning, engineering automation, and strong operations and emphasize professional development around these areas 🙌. for real - our weekly conversations range from well, mapping and navigation to competing in friendly online gaming. but whether you like to play online games or you share our love for an afternoon tea/coffee break like us, we’d be stoked to have you join the fam!
